Just a template. Consider updating the admin-training link with one to the right branch. Also replace GCC mention with some other admin event or next GCC.

Hi Galaxy Admins!

Now that you're all home safely, we wanted to get in touch for a couple of different topics, but mostly reminders of ways you can stay in touch with the Galaxy Admin community and continue to get any help you need with Galaxy administration.

**Survey**

If you didn't fill it out at the end of the training, [take the survey now!](https://bsc3.typeform.com/to/X5bqFf) We need this data to improve the admin training, and most importantly we need to know if we taught you things that were useful whenever the 6-month post-training survey comes out, so please help us :)


**Training Materials**

Everything you were taught in the past few days can be found in the [Galaxy Admin Training](https://github.com/galaxyproject/admin-training/) repository, which mostly points to the [admin section](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/) of the Galaxy Training Materials.

For those of you who also need to do some Galaxy development, there is a [dev section of training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/) for those topics as well. There you can learn to integrate webhooks and tours, and learn about advanced tool development. For those who need to [teach Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/instructors/) or want to [contribute training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/), we have lots of tutorials for you!

**Community**

Chat with us on Gitter!

**Events**

BCC2020 is happening from 18-20 July in Toronto, Canada this year! [Find out more here](https://bcc2020.github.io/)

For those of you who cannot make it, the 2020 European Galaxy Days will be happening in Paris in late November.

Or find out about future [events](https://galaxyproject.org/events/) on the Galaxy Hub.

**For your Users**

We recommend setting the `helpsite_url` in your Galaxy configuration to point to [https://help.galaxyproject.org/](https://help.galaxyproject.org/) where users can go and chat with each other. It's a great resource to help your users be independent and self-sufficient in their Galaxy learning. Admins are welcome too!

And don't forget that many, many [training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/) already exist covering different areas of \*omics and other research done with Galaxy. This can be a great resource for either giving training courses to your users (join the train-the-trainer session at GCC if you want to learn more) or to just point users to as a self-directed learning resource.

If you're asked to provide training infrastructure for your users, but do not have the capacity to support this, UseGalaxy.eu provides [training infrastructure](https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas) for free.

**Going Forward**

We are working on updating the training materials with feedback from the training, and looking into the possibility to develop some automated linting of configurations, to help make Galaxy deployment more error-proof.

Let us know if you have any questions or feedback! Chat on Gitter, file issues on GitHub, let us know what features are interesting and important to the admin community.


Thanks for joining us!

Your Galaxy Admin Training Team
