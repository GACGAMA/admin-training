subject: Galaxy Admin Training Followup

Just a template. Consider updating the admin-training link with one to the right branch. Also replace GCC mention with some other admin event or next GCC.

Hi Galaxy Admins!

Now that you're all home safely, we wanted to get in touch for a couple of different topics, but mostly reminders of ways you can stay in touch with the Galaxy Admin community and continue to get any help you need with Galaxy administration

**Training Materials**

Everything you were taught in the past few days can be found in the [admin-training](https://github.com/galaxyproject/admin-training/) repository, which mostly points to the [admin section](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/admin/) of the training materials site.

For those of you who also need to do some Galaxy development, there is a [section of training materials](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/dev/) for those topics as well. There you can learn to integrate webhooks and tours, and learn about advanced tool development.

**Community**

Chat with us on Gitter!

 - [Galaxy admins](http://gitter.im/galaxyproject/admins)

**Events**

GCC2019 is happening from 1-6 July in Freiburg, Germany this year! We have a new schedule than previous years, and will have one track, for an entire day, dedicated to the admin and developer community. We'll have talks and trainings happening throughout that day.

We're going to restart bi-monthly Galaxy Admins conference calls on [February 28](https://galaxyproject.org/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/2019-02-28/), we'll invite you to bring your updates on your Galaxy instances, any issues you're encountering and how you're dealing with them.

**For your Users**

We recommend setting the `helpsite_url` in your Galaxy configuration to point to [https://help.galaxyproject.org/](https://help.galaxyproject.org/) where users can go and chat with each other. It's a great resource to help your users be independent and self-sufficient in their Galaxy learning. Admins can use this site as well for longer form discussion, if you prefer that to chat.

And don't forget that many, many [training materials](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/) already exist covering many different areas of \*omics and other research done with Galaxy. This can be a great resource for either giving training courses to your users (join the train-the-trainer session at GCC if you want to leanr more) or to just point users to as a self-directed learning resource.

If you're asked to provide training infrastructure for your users, but do not have the capacity to support this, UseGalaxy.eu provides [training infrastructure](https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas) for free.

**Going Forward**

We are working on updating the training materials with feedback from the training, and looking into the possibility to develop some automated linting of configurations, to help make Galaxy deployment more error-proof. We are working on the finalised versions of the playbooks and will share them when it has all been consolidated and corrected.
Let us know if you have any questions or feedback! Chat on gitter, file issues on GitHub, let us know what features are interesting and important to the admin community.


Thanks for joining us this past week!
Your Galaxy Admin Training Team
