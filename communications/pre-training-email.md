Instructors: I suggest you send a welcome email with technical instructions, gitter, etc.
Just a template. Consider updating the dagobah-training link with one to the right branch. Also replace GCC mention with some other admin event or next GCC.

Welcome!

You all will be arriving in Barcelona soon for the [Admin Training](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2020-03-admin/) and we wanted to give you a couple reminders about the upcoming event! A separate email will be sent regarding travel logistics

**Technical Requirements**

You absolutely need a wifi enabled laptop, with an SSH client.

We will provide VMs for you on which you will do everything during the week, so you don't need a super powerful laptop or anything. You do need to have an SSH client pre-installed. When we start on Monday morning we will be starting immediately, and we don't want anyone to fall behind :)

For Linux & OSX: You should have an ssh client already installed. Try running the command 'ssh' in the terminal to check and as long as it doesn't say "command not found" you're probably ok.
For Windows: Please install PuTTY, or equivalent: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

**Educational Requirements**

By the time of the workshop, you should be familiar with the *linux command line*. Everyone has a different background and if you haven't had to learn unix shell basics before that's ok! We recommend that you go through [these lessons](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) from The [Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/about/).

Additionally you need to be comfortable with a command line text editor. If you have not had to use one before, then nano is recommended. If you have a preferred one (e.g. vim or emacs), you are welcome to use that.

**Community Requirements**

Everyone is expected to abide by the Code of Conduct that you signed before this training. We want this to be a welcoming and friendly environment for everyone! Please see the [CoC](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information and the point of contact for any issues.

**Training Materials**

Everything we teach during the week will be found on the [Galaxy Training Materials](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/admin/). If you are worried about the teaching pace of the upcoming week, feel free to read through these materials ahead of time and familiarise yourself with the concepts. Our [preliminary schedule](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training/) is available, but subject to change at any moment.

**Community**

There is a special chat room just for these training events. Come and [introduce yourself](https://gitter.im/dagobah-training/Lobby) if you like! Even if you decide not to participate there, we will likely share URLs or snippets of code in that chat during the week, so it is important that you know where to find it.



We hope you are as excited as we are!

Your Galaxy Admin Training Team
