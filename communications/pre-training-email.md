Welcome!

The [2021 Galaxy Admin Training](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2021-01-admin-training/) is beginning soon and we wanted to give you a couple reminders about the upcoming event!

**Community Requirements**

Everyone is expected to abide by the Code of Conduct (CoC) that you signed before this training. We want this to be a welcoming and friendly environment for everyone! Please see the [CoC](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information and the point of contact for any issues.

**Technical Requirements**

You absolutely need a wifi enabled computer, with an SSH client.

We will provide VMs for you on which you will do everything during the week, so you don't need a super powerful laptop or anything. You do need to have an SSH client pre-installed. When we start on Monday morning we will be starting immediately, and we don't want anyone to fall behind :)

For Windows: Please install PuTTY, or equivalent: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
For Linux & OSX: You should have an ssh client already installed. Try running the command 'ssh' in the terminal to check. If it says "command not found" something is wrong!

**Educational Requirements**

By the time of the workshop, you should be familiar with the *Unix command line*. Everyone has a different background and if you haven't had to learn Unix shell basics before that's ok! We recommend that you go through the [The Unix Shell lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/about/).

Additionally you need to be comfortable with a command-line text editor. If you have not had to use one before, then `nano` is recommended. If you have a preferred one (e.g. vim or emacs), you are welcome to use that.

**Conversation**

We have created a Slack for this event. You **must** join this slack, all important information will be communicated there. [Click here to join](https://join.slack.com/t/galaxyadmintraining/shared_invite/zt-kswf6j39-cgllk4JdyT6Vg98DH63lzw)

**Training Materials**

Everything we teach during the week will be found on the [Galaxy Training Materials](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/admin/) website. If you are worried about the teaching pace of the upcoming week, feel free to read through these materials ahead of time and familiarise yourself with the concepts. Our [preliminary schedule](https://github.com/galaxyproject/admin-training/) is available, but subject to change.

**Virtual Machines**

We are providing the infrastructure this week, this will remain online until 5 business days following the conclusion of the event.


We hope you are as excited as we are!

Your Galaxy Admin Training Team
