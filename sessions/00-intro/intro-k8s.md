# Deployment Options

Galaxy has many options, configuration possibilities, and deployment paradigms.

Therefore, we are covering a single method of installing and configuring Galaxy, which gives a best practice,
modern, scalable installation of Galaxy, based on Kubernetes.

The main advantage is that this same method can be used on a laptop, a server or on the cloud, requiring
that you learn it only once.
