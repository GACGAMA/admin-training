# Clouds?

**Cloud computing** ... is a model for enabling ubiquitous, **on-demand** access to a **shared pool** of configurable **computing resources** ... which can be **rapidly provisioned and released** with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage ... may be located far from the user â€“ ranging in distance from **across a city to across the world.** - Wikipedia, Cloud Computing.

# Available Clouds

.large[
* Commercial: Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure
  * Pay-per-time/machine etc.
  * Reasonably priced, but keep an eye on the costs
  * Large range of machine (i.e., instance) types
  * Education grants
* Academic:
  * OpenStack: open source community project
  * NeCTAR in Australia, Jetstream in USA, CLIMB in UK, lots of others
  * Some free for researchers (NeCTAR, CLIMB), some with project grants (Jetstream)

# Why Clouds?

.large[
* Elastic compute!
  * Can dynamically resource analyses
* No need to maintain the hardware
  * Provider takes on cost of hardware and maintenance
  * Cost is shared between all users
* Move the compute to the data
  * Data on East Coast?
  * Start compute there. Save on data transfer.

# Galaxy on the Cloud

.large[
* There are cloud images (VM blueprints) available
  * with Galaxy pre-installed
  * with different sets of tools installed
  * with access to reference data
  * for different clouds (AWS globally, Jetstream, NeCTAR, CLIMB etc.)
* You just need credentials for the cloud you want to "launch" on.
  * Credentials are generally strings
  * An access key and a secret key or username and password with project details
  * They are obtained from the cloud account admin page you want to use

# CloudLaunch

.large[
* CloudLaunch is a system for launching Galaxy (and other applications) on cloud resources
  * Public server available at [launch.usegalaxy.org](https://launch.usegalaxy.org)
  * You can also install and run your own
  * Fill in the credential details, choose a location and machine size
  * Press go!
* CloudLaunch will now provision you a computer in the cloud with Galaxy installed and ready to go.
  * Depending on your choices and availability you will also have access to reference data and various tools
  * It should only take 2-3 minutes for everything to be set up.

# Cloud Manager

.center[![cloudman](images/cloudman_logo.png)]

.large[
* Cloud manager: middleware to control cloud clusters
* Can be used to control system and application services, such as Galaxy
* Can mount filesystems, dynamically add/remove worker nodes, start/stop services

# Cluster on the Cloud?

.large[
* Your CloudMan instance is a single machine
  * It is the "Head node" of a cluster
* CloudMan can start "worker" nodes.
  * More cloud instances (of any size)
  * Automatically connects to file system
  * Are registered in Slurm setup
  * A node will take ~2-3 minutes to start and configure.

# Auto-Scaling

.large[
* Can set up dynamic scaling to respond to the system load
  * Upper and lower node numbers
  * When queue is full and jobs wait certain time, new nodes are launched.

# CloudMan Galaxy

.large[
* Your Galaxy server is set up and ready to go!
  * Includes large list of pre-installed tools.
  * Includes access to reference data files
  * Zero-to-go in less than 10 minutes.
* Toolsets and reference sets can be tailored to suit needs
  * Will be discussed in architecture section

# Persistence

.large[
* Cloud instances are typically transient
  * Can be terminated and resources returned to the pool
* However, user data and cluster configuration can be persisted
  * Then can be attached to new instance when they start
* CloudMan stores an instance's set up in an object store container for persistence

# Looking to the future

.large[
* Cloudlaunch has a Pulsar appliance
* As of Galaxy version 19.01
    * You can make dynamic rules to look for your pulsar appliances in the cloud
    * Automatically connect to them
    * Send jobs to them
