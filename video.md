# Tips for Preparing Video Lectures

> Mostly, just don't think it needs to be perfect. The real time killer is that you can undo things and correct your mistakes, but don't start with that unless it's been really bad.

> Record things in a modular way. Don't create one giant video, but several small ones (one for each subtopic or so). That way it's much easier to exchange parts of the content (less downloading, importing, reuploading).

## The Happy Path

1. Get your workspace setup, close unnecessary tabs, etc.
2. Open your slides / terminal / etc.
3. We recommend starting a Zoom call with yourself, and then using the record function
4. Record your video in small chunks where possible.

   - E.g. for the Ansible Galaxy tutorial, it should be made modular
   - One video per top level section. (Works nicely to intersperse with slides videos.)
