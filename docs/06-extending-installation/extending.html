# Securing your Object IDs

In `galaxy.yml`:
* User facing object IDs
  * Galaxy uses the Blowfish cipher to obscure integer IDs.
  * Prevents guessing the hashes for various Galaxy objects.
  * `id_secret` is used as the Blowfish key.
  * Changing `id_secret` is highly recommended.
  * Changing `id_secret` will change & invalid existing URLs (e.g. datasets, histories, workflows, etc).
* Try changing the `id_secret`. What happens?

# Update the welcome page

Welcome page is `$GALAXY_ROOT/static/welcome.html` and is the first thing that
users see. It is a good idea to extend it with things like:
- Downtimes/Maintenance periods
- New tools
- Publications relating to your Galaxy

No restarting is necessary.

# Client Browser Security

* `use_printdebug` anything "print"ed within a Galaxy Web thread is exposed to user. Set to False in production.
* `use_interactive` Enabled by default. Enable live debugging in your browser.  This should *never* be enabled on a public site.
