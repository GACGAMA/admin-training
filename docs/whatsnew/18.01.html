## What's new?

---
class: middle

## What's new? uWSGI!

--

*"But wait, that's not new..."*

???
indeed, Galaxy has supported running under uWSGI for years, however...

---
class: middle, top-title

## uWSGI

Not new *but*:

- uWSGI will be the default server for new installs
- Your Galaxy config can now be in YAML
- Lots of development work into improving Galaxy/uWSGI integration
- Job handlers run as uWSGI *Mules*
- uWSGI now comes with Galaxy (as a *wheel*)<sup>[1]</sup>

.footnote[
<sup>[1] Eagle-eyed viewers might have noticed that it was added to Galaxy in 17.09, but it has not been used by Galaxy itself until 18.01.</sup>

## uWSGI

- **uWSGI will be the default server for new installs**
- Your Galaxy config can now be in YAML
- Lots of development work into improving Galaxy/uWSGI integration
- Job handlers run as uWSGI Mules
- uWSGI now comes with Galaxy (as a *wheel*)

---
class: middle, top-title

## uWSGI as the default

What changes? If you have an existing Galaxy config and are using:

- Paste, or
- external uWSGI (e.g. from APT), or
- uWSGI you installed in to Galaxy's virtualenv (e.g. with `pip`),

Then: **nothing changes**

Only new installs (started using `run.sh`) use uWSGI

*Why don't I automatically get the latest and greatest new features when I upgrade?*

.smaller[
Or, a brief diversion in to the philosophy of admin-oriented Galaxy development
]

---
class: largeish

## Philosophy of Admin-Oriented Development

- Many Galaxy administrators are not system administrators
- Nobody is a full time Galaxy administrator
- Galaxy is a complex piece of software that can break in inscrutible ways<sup>[1]</sup>
- Galaxy can be difficult to update, especially for those who don't administrate it daily
- We do not want to discourage admins from updating, especially in light of security flaws in unsupported releases

.footnote[
<sup>[1] I am not disparaging Galaxy's quality, but with as wide a scope as Galaxy has, this is inevitable (to some degree). It is continually improving, as well!</sup>
]

--

Thus, the philosophy: *Everything should always work the way it did before*.

--

However,
- it only needs to *appear* that it works the same way from the outside, and
- we should provide tools for admins to migrate to new best practices painlessly.

---

## uWSGI as the default

**Previously**, a config file was *required*.

We hid this detail a bit by reading `galaxy.ini.sample` if `galaxy.ini` was not present

--

**Now**:
- If no config exists, all necessary defaults are generated as command line arguments to uWSGI
- If a config exists, it is parsed, and any missing required options are passed as command line arguments to uWSGI
- The sample is never used

---

## uWSGI default command line

Without a config file, the uWSGI command line is:

```sh-session
$ /home/nate/galaxy/.venv/bin/python2.7 .venv/bin/uwsgi \
    --module 'galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp:uwsgi_app()' \
    --virtualenv /home/nate/galaxy/.venv --pythonpath lib \
    --threads 4 --http localhost:8080 \
    --static-map /static/style=/home/nate/galaxy/static/style/blue \
    --static-map /static=/home/nate/galaxy/static --die-on-term \
    --hook-master-start 'unix_signal:2 gracefully_kill_them_all' \
    --hook-master-start 'unix_signal:15 gracefully_kill_them_all' \
    --enable-threads --py-call-osafterfork
```

--

Wait, what's this?...

```sh-session
$ /home/nate/galaxy/.venv/bin/python2.7 .venv/bin/uwsgi
```

But uWSGI is written in C! More on this later...

???
more on this in the uWSGI-as-a-wheel section

---
class: middle, top-title

## uWSGI command line

Behind the scenes, `run.sh` calls `scripts/get_uwsgi_args.py`, which:
- locates your config file (if any),
- parses it to determine whether you have set any of the default (or conflicting) options,
- determines the flags needed to run Galaxy

You can take "full control" over this process by skipping `run.sh` and simply
calling `uwsgi` directly.

---
class: middle, top-title

## uWSGI

- uWSGI will be the default server for new installs
- **Your Galaxy config can now be in YAML**
- Lots of development work into improving Galaxy/uWSGI integration
- Job handlers run as uWSGI Mules
- uWSGI now comes with Galaxy (as a *wheel*)

???
since you will, of course, actually need a config file

---
class: middle, top-title, center

## YAML config

The INI format is limited, structured data formats (e.g. YAML) are more expressive

uWSGI natively supports YAML configs (and INI, and PasteDeploy INI, and XML, and JSON, and ...)

This allows us to put lists and dictionaries directly in to the main config file!

Galaxy configs can now be either INI or YAML

Going forward some new features may only be configurable in YAML

[galaxy.yml.sample](https://github.com/jmchilton/galaxy/blob/78992968ecd0de1f95b99352b53ea2ecd246f954/config/galaxy.yml.sample)

---
class: middle, top-title

## YAML config

Here's a bit of what's possible:

```yaml
---
uwsgi:
    http: 127.0.0.1:8080

galaxy:
    database_connection: postgresql:///galaxy
    admin_users: >
      nate@bx.psu.edu,
      foo@bar.baz,
      leeroy@jenkins-ci.org
    logging:
        handlers:
            file:
                filename: galaxy.log
        loggers:
            galaxy:
                handlers:
                    - file
```

- YAML line folding is used with `admin_users` to make the value more readable
- `logging` is complex data structure of nested dictionaries and lists

---

## YAML config

*But I don't want to convert my long and tedious `galaxy.ini` to YAML!*

--

Good news! There is a `galaxy.ini`-to-`galaxy.yml` conversion tool:

```sh-session
$ make config-convert-dry-run
$ make config-convert
$ make config-validate
$ make config-lint
```

--

It is now possible to validate and lint the Galaxy config file!

Config names are defined and their values are typed in [config_schema.yml](https://github.com/jmchilton/galaxy/blob/78992968ecd0de1f95b99352b53ea2ecd246f954/lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/config_schema.yml)

---
class: middle, top-title

## Configuration Schema

`config_schema.yml` is also the canonical source for config option documentation, from which:
- `galaxy.yml.sample` is generated
- [Galaxy configuration options documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/index.html) is generated<sup>[1]</sup>

.footnote[
<sup>[1] Found in [#5105](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/5105/) prior to the 18.01 release).</sup>
]

---
class: middle, top-title, center

## Future config plans

Integrate Galaxy's 27<sup>[1]</sup> config files in their myriad of formats, in to a single config file: **galaxy.yml**

However, we'll add `include` support so you can break configs up in a structure that makes sense for your site

But then you'll only have 1 config file path to worry about (at least as far as Galaxy is concerned)

.footnote[
<sup>[1] Just guessing here but... there are a lot</sup>

## uWSGI

- uWSGI will be the default server for new installs
- Your Galaxy config can now be in YAML
- **Lots of development work into improving Galaxy/uWSGI integration**
- Job handlers run as uWSGI Mules
- uWSGI now comes with Galaxy (as a *wheel*)

---
class: middle, top-title, center

## Integration

The aforementioned YAML Galaxy config support is all new for 18.01 and required quite a bit of modification to Galaxy

Galaxy's logging configuration and initalization was reworked due to the fact that Paste handled logging set up in most cases

Advanced logging control was not possible without Paste, and with job handler Mules, advanced config became necessary

---
class: middle, center

## Documentation!

Galaxy's languishing admin documentation has been greatly improved!

---
class: middle, top-title

## Documentation!!

We are consolidating documentation that is release-specific in to the Galaxy codebase documentation:
- Documentation that lives with the code is more likely to be updated when the code it references is updated
- Provides a way to version documentation with releases so you can consult relevant documentation for your Galaxy release

Hosted at [docs.galaxyproject.org](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/)

Currently only the current (17.09) release is visible, but we will add release selection in the near future

---
class: middle, top-title

## Documentation!!!

Improved documentation<sup>[1]</sup> includes:
- Scaling and Load Balancing
- nginx and Apache proxy configurations
- YAML configuration
- Advanced logging configuration
- Job handler deployment scenarios and configuration

Many of the best practices previously only available in the admin training materials have now been integrated in to the official admin documentation

Probably the biggest integration development effort, however, was on *uWSGI Mules*

---
class: middle, top-title

## uWSGI

- uWSGI will be the default server for new installs
- Your Galaxy config can now be in YAML
- Lots of development work into improving Galaxy/uWSGI integration
- **Job handlers run as uWSGI Mules**
- uWSGI now comes with Galaxy (as a *wheel*)

---
class: largeish

## The Job Handler Problem

In the earliest days of Galaxy, it ran as a single process

As load grew, the largely asynchronous tasks related to handling jobs began to interfere with servicing web requests

--

Our solution was to run multiple Paste, and later, standalone python "webless" Galaxy servers dedicated to job handling

Managing these processes was tedious:
- Add `[server:handlerN]` to `galaxy.ini`
- Add `handlerN` to `job_conf.xml`
- Modify Supervisord config for new handler

Job handlers were assigned at random from the configured options with no regard to their health and notified via the database

--

As production servers shifted to uWSGI for web serving, the configuration became more complex as multiple types of processes needed to be managed

uWSGI presented a unique solution: *Mules*

---
class: middle, top-title

## uWSGI Mules

**Mules** are processes forked from the uWSGI master after the application has been loaded

Mules can continue to run the same code or can load and run arbitrary code

Mules can receive messages from the web proceses

Mules can be pooled in to *Farms*, and messages can be sent to the farm to be handled by any mule in that farm

This design made mules ideally suited to perform as Galaxy job handlers

---
class: middle, top-title

## Mule Advantages

- Mules are spawned by the uWSGI *master process* and therefore are killed with it
- Due to farm messaging, mules can self-assign jobs

Thus, with mules **there is no multiprocess management complexity** and **no job conf changes are required**

In addition, **nonresponsive mules cannot be assigned jobs**

---
class: middle, top-title

## Job Handler Mule Configuration

Adding job handler mules is performed by simply instructing uWSGI to start them in `galaxy.yml`:

```yaml
uwsgi:
    mule: lib/galaxy/main.py
    mule: lib/galaxy/main.py
    farm: job-handlers:1,2
```

That's it! This Galaxy instance will now start and use two job handler mules.

---
class: middle, top-title, largeish

## How Mules Work

1. Master process loads Galaxy
2. Master `fork()`s web worker processes
3. Master `fork()`s job handler mules
4. Mules reload Galaxy as job handlers
5. The first mule to fully initialize grabs a lock on the message queue
6. All additional mules wait on the lock
7. A web worker receives a request for a new job
8. The web worker creates a `job` record in the database but leaves the `handler` field `null`
9. The web worker uses uWSGI's `farm_msg()` function to notify the `job-handlers` farm that a new job is ready to run
10. The mule with the lock receives the message, assigns itself, and gives up the lock
11. Another mule acquires the lock and waits for the next message
12. Job handling continues as normal

---
class: middle, top-title, center

## Mule Messaging Implementation

Mule messaging is simply a socket open between the processes - it is up to you to implement the protocol

For this, we developed a generic JSON-based message format and routing system so that any Galaxy component can utilize mules

This leaves many possibilities for offloading work across Galaxy

---
class: middle, top-title, center

## Job Configuration

All of the previous handler-mapping functionality is still supported with mules

Tools can be statically or dynamically mapped to specific mules

---
class: middle, top-title

## uWSGI

- uWSGI will be the default server for new installs
- Your Galaxy config can now be in YAML
- Lots of development work into improving Galaxy/uWSGI integration
- Job handlers run as uWSGI Mules
- **uWSGI now comes with Galaxy (as a *wheel*)**

---
class: middle, top-title

## uWSGI Wheel

- The goal: Provide a no-compilation-required installation method for Galaxy that included uWSGI
- Rationale:
  - The Galaxy admin does not need to have a complex build environment on the server
  - We do not need to maintain a list of ever-changing per-distribution build-time dependencies
  - It makes installation fast and failproof (especially for development and CI)
  - We do this for all of Galaxy's other C dependencies
- The challenge:
  - Unlike Galaxy's other dependencies, uWSGI is not a Python library
  - uWSGI sits on the front side of Galaxy, rather than the back

---

## uWSGI Wheel

The uWSGI wheel is built differently than when built from source with `pip install uwsgi`

- From source by pip:
  - Built as a single `uwsgi` ELF binary
- As a wheel:
  - Built as a Python C extension into an ELF shared library
  - Loaded by a stub `uwsgi` Python script

--

Remember?:

```sh-session
$ /home/nate/galaxy/.venv/bin/python2.7 .venv/bin/uwsgi
```

---
class: middle, top-title

## uWSGI Wheel

Remember?:

```sh-session
$ /home/nate/galaxy/.venv/bin/python2.7 .venv/bin/uwsgi
```

Well:

```sh-session
$ cat /home/nate/galaxy/.venv/bin/uwsgi
#!/home/nate/galaxy/.venv/bin/python2.7

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import re
import sys

from uwsgi import run

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\.pyw?|\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(run())
```

---
class: middle, top-title

## uWSGI Wheel

What does this all mean?

Usefulness of the wheel for production servers:
- You aren't redeploying Galaxy repeatedly
- Performing `pip install uwsgi` and waiting 10 seconds is no big deal
- You can also install uWSGI from the system package manager

We have found, reported, and fixed a few bugs with uWSGI-as-shared-library, there are still some outstanding

Installing uWSGI from source via `pip` or the system package manager is still a reasonable approach for production servers

---

## A useful incantation

For replacing wheel uWSGI in the virtualenv with one built from source:

```sh-session
$ /home/nate/galaxy/.venv/bin/pip uninstall uwsgi
Uninstalling uWSGI-2.0.15:
  /home/nate/galaxy/.venv/bin/uwsgi

Proceed (y/n)? y
