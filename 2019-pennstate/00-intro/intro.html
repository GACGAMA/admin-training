Almost all of this content is freshly revised, there may be sessions that are too long or short - apologies in advance.

# Training philosophy

Galaxy has many options, configuration possibilities, and deployment paradigms. Our trainings used to cover multiple paths which made them longer, less focused, and prone to errors.

This time we adapted our training to follow the `one true path`(c) - which is usually the one we use for `usegalaxy.*` servers - most tested and stable path.

Galaxy has all the options and possibilities as before, but unless you are opinionated/locked in we recommend staying on the `one true path`(c). If you can't Galaxy comes with documentation and community to help.
