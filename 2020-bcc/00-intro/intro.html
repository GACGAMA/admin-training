# On Session Times

We do not have much experience with the Remo platform or with teaching these topics purely online.

Sessions may not keep precisely to the times in the schedule.

We will prioritize the group's average progress over rushing to cover all materials at any cost.

---
# Communication channels

![Remo chat](images/remo_overview.jpg)

---
# Questions and Answers

Participants write questions to a shared Google Doc, and we can answer them in
more depth than we could in person, with links and images.

---

# Measuring progress

Throughout the training we will use the Remo Q&A capabilities to estimate your progress and adapt the training speed.

# Computing resources

The computing resources for this training have been provided by **de.NBI**

Claim your VM and find its IP address at **https://gxy.io/gatmachines** [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11nQKJmHHf7GWR_C36rdu2dVOHZZ0cXpv09b84txm_3A/edit?usp=sharing). Put it somewhere easy to copy/paste.

# Training philosophy and methodology

---
# Lessons learned

...from past trainings

Galaxy has many options, configuration possibilities, and deployment paradigms. Our trainings used to cover multiple paths which made past trainings longer, less focused, and prone to errors.

We often taught the *least complex* method over the *best practice* method.

It was sometimes difficult for students to catch up once behind.

---
# Training philosophy

We now follow the best way to do things - which is usually the one we use for **usegalaxy.* servers** - the most tested and stable path.

Galaxy has all the options and possibilities as before, but unless you are opinionated/locked in we recommend staying on the recommended path.

For other paths, Galaxy comes with documentation and a friendly community to help.

---
# New methodology

For this training, materials have been reworked to utilize **Ansible** much more heavily *from the beginning*.

We consider the use of config management tools (such as Ansible) to be essential to good system administration.

---
# On Ansible

Use of Ansible to install/admin Galaxy is in no way required, and some prefer other tools (e.g. Puppet, Chef, etc.).

What we teach in Ansible can be used as the knowledge/reference base for implementation in your preferred config management system.<sup>[1]</sup>

When using Ansible in this course, we will inspect the changes made after each step, to ensure a good understanding of what is taking place behind the magic.

.footnote[<sup>[1]</sup> Bonus: We have written an enormous amount of Ansible roles for community consumption. If you do not have a preference, Ansible is a good choice (at least for deploying Galaxy) for this reason.]
